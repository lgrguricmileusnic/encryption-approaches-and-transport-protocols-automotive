# Description

AutoSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) SecOC (Security On-board Communication) is a security architecture that aims to protect the communication between the various electronic control units (ECUs) within a vehicle against cyber-attacks.

- SecOC is an AUTOSAR module
- Provides integrity and authentication for messages (PDUs)
- Freshness protects against replay attacks
- Generic specification which can operate with asymmetric or symmetric cryptography
- Key distribution is not specified
    
- Every PDU has a unique identifier (SecOCDataID).
    - On CAN networks, the CAN identifier is used.
    - On Ethernet networks, the PDU identifier or internal mappings for PDU identifier to SecOCDataIDs are used.

AutoSAR specifies three different profiles with different sizes for truncated freshness value and truncated MAC. All profiles use CMAC with AES128

- SecOC Profile 1 (or 24Bit-CMAC-8Bit-FV)
    - Algorithm: CMAC/AES-128
    - truncated freshness value: 8 bits
    - truncated MAC: 24 bits
        
- SecOC Profile 2 (or 24Bit-CMAC-No-FV)
    - Algorithm: CMAC/AES-128
    - truncated freshness value: 0 bits
    - truncated MAC: 24 bits
    - Donâ€™t use freshness values at all
        
- SecOC Profile 3 (or JASPAR)
    - Algorithm: CMAC/AES-128
    - length of freshness value: 64 bits
    - truncated freshness value: 4 bits
    - truncated MAC: 28 bits
