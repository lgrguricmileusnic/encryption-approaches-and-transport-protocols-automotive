Â - compare cryptographic cipher performance in automotive environments
	- in vehicle
		- compare ciphers from competitions like CAESAR, ASCON?
			- AES
		- define requirements and use-cases
		- simulate using microcontroller devboards?
			- esp, stm, rpi pico?
		- mostly wired communication
			- CAN, automotive ethernet
		- AUTOSAR
		- identify attack vectors
			- threat modeling
