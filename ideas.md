- compare cryptographic cipher performance in automotive environments
	- in vehicle, v2x
		- different requirements (hard vs soft realtime, stronger ciphers in v2x?)
	- in vehicle
		- compare ciphers from competitions like CAESAR?
		- simulate using microcontroller devboards?
			- esp, stm, rpi pico?
		- mostly wired communication
			- CAN, automotive ethernet
	- v2x
		- OTA updates
		- communication with smart infrastructure? (research, examples)
		- v2v communication
		- testable with Linux machines (car telematics and infotainments are mostly running linux)
